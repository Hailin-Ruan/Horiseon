## Project Description

This was an existing code which I refactored to meet accessibility standards which is an important aspect of web development. This approach ensures that individuals with disabilities can effectively navigate websites by utilizing various assistive technologies, including screen readers, video captions, and more. In addition to its ethical implications, ensuring accessibility offers notable business benefits. For instance, accessible websites enjoy enhanced visibility on popular search engines like Google.
